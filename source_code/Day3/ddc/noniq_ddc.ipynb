    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is a demonstration of a working Non-IQ Digital Down-Conversion (DDC) that is part of the LLRF firmware in this class.\n",
    "Read http://recycle.lbl.gov/~ldoolitt/llrf/down/reconstruct.pdf for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test bench injects a sinusoidal waveform with amplitude of `SIG_AMP_CNT` and phase of `SIG_PHS_DEG` after clock cycle `CC_N0` to the DDC module `noniq_ddc.v`, which takes 6 clock cycles of latency, to produce an interleaved stream of base band I,Q signals, which is then separated with interpolation by `fiq_interp.v` by 4 cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test bench also checks the expected amplitude and phase response with the produced signals, using the equations we showed in the lecture.\n",

    "# Exercises\n",

    "## Run simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following command will generate a waveform file, and check results.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make noniq_ddc.vcd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect the waveform for timing and scaling of the process.\n",
    "Adjust parameters of the test bench file `noniq_ddc_tb.v` for stimulus signal amplitude and phase and check results.\n"
