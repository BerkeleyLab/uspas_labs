    "This lab will guide you through the CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) introduced in the lecture. Much of the code is derived from Berkeley Lab's [`bedrock/cordic`](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/Bedrock/tree/master/cordic) repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Berkeley Lab's [cordic](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/Bedrock/tree/master/cordic) module for the following lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit under test is `cordicg_b22.v`, which is generated by `cordicgx.py` with 22 bits internal data path width. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input data width of `xin`, `yin` is configurable as a parameter of testbench, defined by `DW` in `Makefile`. The number of stages `NSTG` is also an parameter of the test bench.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test both Polar to Rectangular, and Rectangular to Polar conversion.\n",

    "Use `make` to build test bench, run simulation and print results for analysis. Details check `Makefile`\n",

    "## Polar to Rectangular\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an ordinary P->R set `yin` to zero. It's also possible to use that mode for general vector rotation of the input `(xin, yin)` vector by angle `phasein`, which is the case using the test bench.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the CORDIC propagation delay of `NSTG` cycles are already taken care of, so that the printed data is an aligned row of `\"T [ns]\", \"phasein\", \"xin\", \"yin\", \"xout\", \"yout\", \"phaseout\"` at every clock cycle .\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay attention to the full scale of `phasein` and `phaseout` ports, which has `DW+1` data width. The full scale of these two signals are $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the CORDIC accuracy by comparing the expected vector after rotation and its output `(xout, yout)` for all data. What's the peak to peak and RMS error percentage?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rectangular to Polar\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an ordinary R->P computation set `phasein` to zero.  A non-zero `phasein` in that mode will simply be added to the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test bench will work in the prior case. Check the CORDIC accuracy by comparing the expected amplitude and angle of `(xin, yin)` and the CORDIC output `xout`, `phaseout` respectively. What's the peak to peak and RMS error percentage?\n",
