    "# Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "## RTL logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of this LED blinker is simply a 32 bit counter, in `led_test.v`:\n",
    "```verilog\n",
    "module led_test #(\n",
    "    parameter MSB = 27\n",
    ") (\n",
    "    input clk,\n",
    "    input reset,\n",
    "    output [3:0] led\n",
    ");\n",
    "reg [31:0] cnt=0;\n",
    "always @(posedge clk) begin\n",
    "    cnt <= reset ? 32'h0 : cnt + 1'b1;\n",
    "end\n",
    "assign led = cnt[MSB:MSB-3];\n",
    "endmodule\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the frequency of `clk` is 100 MHz, what's the expected LED blinking rate for each bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build test bench\n",
    "\n",
    "We use an open source simulator [Icuras Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) which is available on most Linux / MacOS platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the testbench `led_test_tb` from source file `led_test_tb.v` and `led_test.v`, run\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "iverilog -Wall -Wno-timescale -o led_test_tb led_test_tb.v led_test.v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to most compliers, this building process is defined by a rule in `labs/rules.mk`, and now we can just run\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make led_test_tb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run behavioral simulation and build waveform\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the executable `led_test_tb` is ready to run, and we do it by `vvp`, with argument of `+vcd` so that it saves the history of logics in the form of *waveforms* that can be examined later.\n",
    "The command is\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vvp -N led_test_tb +vcd\n",
    "```\n",
    "or by `make`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make led_test.vcd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examine waveform\n",
    "\n",
    "We use another open source tool `gtkwave` to view the waveform file, by\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gtkwave led_test.vcd led_test.gtkw\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `led_test.gtkw` is the settings of the view.\n",
    "Or we can do it by `make`,\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make led_test_view\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note this won't work on a MacOS, where one need to manually launch `gtkwave` app, unless an additional command line tool is [installed](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/gtkwave).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Synthesize:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two `tcl` scripts (`synth_*.tcl`) are provided to send things to Xilinx `vivado` for synthesizing, including `led_test.v`, the constraint file that describes pin mapping and timing and a top level verilog file. Try:\n",
    "\n",
    "* for Arty A7\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make arty_led_top.bit\n",
    "```\n",
    "* for Marble\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "make marble_led_top.bit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the last step in the `tcl` script, the bitstream file is generated, which we will test on hardware next.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are co-product of the synthesizing process: the utilization and timing reports are generated in the log on the terminal.\n",
    "For example, for arty A7,\n",
