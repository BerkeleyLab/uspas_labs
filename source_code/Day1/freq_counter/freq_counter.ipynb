    "\n",
    "This is a demo about a frequency meter, which is extremely important for LLRF applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core design is from Larry Doolittle as in [`freq_count.v`](https://github.com/BerkeleyLab/Bedrock/blob/master/dsp/freq_count.v), with test bench. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rest is to make a multiple channels frontend (`freq_multi_count_fe.v`), and code for human interface, including a [binary-coded decimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal) decoder (`b2decimal.v`), a `printf()`-like ASCII character translator, and a simple [UART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter) driver (`simpleuart.v`), all wrapped together within `freq_demo.v`, which was instantiated by the top level `freq_demo_top.v`, where the *unknown* clock is generated by a typical Xilinx PLL primitive ([`MMCM`](https://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/mmcm_module.html)) at the expected frequency of 100 MHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardware is the Digilent Arty A7 FPGA, where the reference clock is also at 100MHz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to get familiar with the concept of clock domain crossing, gray code, UART, etc.\n",

    "Review the source code of `freq_count.v`. Understand the concept of clock domain crossing using [gray code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code), and the need for binary to gray code [conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code#Converting_to_and_from_Gray_code) twice, in both clock domains: unknown frequency domain and the reference domain.\n",
    "The heart of it is the measurement of the difference of the binary representation of a 4-bit counter after the domain crossings at every clock cycle. The difference is then accumulated (or averaged) within the duration defined by its data width (parameter `refcnt_width`), and the result is strobed out once the accumulation cycle is done. Therefore the result is the fractional ratio between the unknown and reference frequencies with `refcnt_width` bit resolution.\n",
